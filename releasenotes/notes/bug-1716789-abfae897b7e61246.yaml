    Change to use ``any`` as the default ``--protocol`` option to
    ``security group rule create`` command when using the Neutron v2 API.
    [Bug `1716789 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1716789>`_]
fixes:
  - |
    The default protocol used to create a security rule was changed to
    ``tcp``, which was a regression from the neutron client when using
    the Neutron v2 API.  Change it back to ``any``, which skips sending
    the protocol to the API server entirely.
upgrade:
  - |
    Users that had been creating rules without specifying a protocol
    and expecting ``tcp`` need to change to use ``--protocol tcp``
    explicitly when using the Neutron v2 API.
